## üö® **Risk Mitigation**

### **Technical Risks**
- **CI/CD Pipeline Failures**: Have backup manual testing process
- **GitHub API Rate Limits**: Monitor usage and optimize queries
- **Test Environment Issues**: Maintain local testing capabilities

### **Process Risks**  
- **Learning Curve**: Allow extra time in Phase 1 for GitHub familiarization
- **Workflow Resistance**: Document clear benefits and efficiency gains
- **Context Switching**: Use `/clear` command religiously between issues

### **Business Risks**
- **Development Slowdown**: Phase implementation gradually without stopping current work
- **Feature Delivery Delays**: Prioritize high-value issues first
- **Quality Regressions**: Maintain manual testing as safety net initially
